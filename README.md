# Problem Statement
The online food ordering market includes foods prepared by restaurants, prepared by independent people, and groceries being ordered online and then picked up or delivered. The first online food ordering service, World Wide Waiter (now known as Waiter.com), was founded in 1995. Online food ordering is the process of ordering food from a website or other application. The product can be either ready-to-eat food or food that has not been specially prepared for direction consumption.
